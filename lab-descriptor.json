  "introduction": "<ul><li>Linear Algebra is a foundational discipline in Science and Engineering, with applications in various fields such as Computer Graphics, Data Science, Physics, Machine Learning and many other technological and scientific domains.</li><li>This lab is designed to make abstract concepts of Linear Algebra easier to understand and hence enable user to apply these wherever needed.</li><li>The theory section is supplemented with schematic representations to facilitate understanding and a deeper appreciation of the intrinsic concepts. Illustrative examples of various types are also provided.</li><li>Simulation is supported by dynamic interface for hands on practice. Dynamic outcomes are linked on multiple pages as and when required.</li><li>Interactive exercises are provided in simulation, making it knowledgeable and interesting.</li><li>Graphical representations are provided in simulation for geometrical visualization.</li><li>Self-assessments in simulation are well aligned with the experiments.</li><li> Pre-tests are structured to enable learners to assess their pre-requisite knowledge from prior experiments or foundational concepts. Post-tests are administered after the experiment and are designed to enable users to evaluate their understanding of the experiment.</li><li>Procedure for simulation has been given separately, while the interface is also user-friendly.</li></ul>",
